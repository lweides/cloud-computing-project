# Project Proposal
The idea of this project is to set up a kubernetes cluster and observe the cluster with Dynatrace. The kubernetes cluster runs multiple microservices and is hosted on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).


Run various dummy microservices in kubernetes and monitor them with dynatrace.
For example, there are microservices A, B, C, D and an "entrypoint", which is more or less the "API".
The microservices simply forward requests back and forth between each other and do random stuff.
